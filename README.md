# The Purr-fect Puppy Bot
Welcome to the Purr-fect Puppy Bot, an automated reddit bot that replies to the phrase "pup4me!" with a link to a random image of a puppy, found from the Dog API.

## -----Project Description-----
This project was made as a fun, side-project in order to complement what I've learned in my first semester Intro to CS class, as well as to play around a little with API's and JSON data. The Purr-fect puppy bot will search a given range of comments on a reddit webpage (subreddit), and will reply with an image link to a puppy, every time it encounters the phrase "pup4me!". This project utilizes the reddit API, PRAW (the Python Reddit API Wrapper), the Dog API, as well as requests and time modules.

## -----Technologies Utilized-----
This reddit bot was created with Python 3.10 and utilizes the Dog API, which can be found here: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/, the reddit API: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/, and PRAW: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.
